The ``4-square`` module
=====================================

Using ``Square``
-------------------------------------

Importing Square to test

>>> Square = __import__('4-square').Square

-------------------------------------

Begin tests

Expected Success:
=====================================

# size is an int
>>> my_square = Square(9)
>>> print("Area: {} for size: {}".format(my_square.area(), my_square.size))
Area: 81 for size: 9

# size is large int
>>> my_square = Square(100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000)
>>> print("Area: {} for size: {}".format(my_square.area(), my_square.size))
Area: 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 for size: 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

# no size passed
>>> my_square = Square()
>>> print("Area: {} for size: {}".format(my_square.area(), my_square.size))
Area: 0 for size: 0

Expected Failures:
=====================================

# size is a string
>>> my_square = Square("size")

# size is a float
>>> my_square = Square(4.5)

# size is negative
>>> my_square = Square(-1)

# size is a boolean
>>> my_square = Square(True)
>>> print("Area: {} for size: {}".format(my_square.area(), my_square.size))
Area: 1 for size: True
